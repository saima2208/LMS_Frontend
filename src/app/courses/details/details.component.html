          <h2>Description</h2>
          <p>
            In this article, I share the 10 best programming books in 2024. But
            what do I mean by programming books? Well, rather than something
            language-specific, like books on Python programming, HTML, CSS, or
            Ruby, here I'll cover general programming books with information and
            skills you can apply in all languages.
          </p>


          Whether you’re new to programming and fresh off a self-taught
          programming course or an experienced professional looking to boost
          your programming skills, I’ve included programming books for beginners
          and pros alike. Plus, with the Bureau of Labor and Statistics
          reporting an average salary of over $100K for programmers, picking up
          a programming book can be the first step to a financially rewarding
          career. So, if you’re ready, let’s dive into the best programming
          books to boost your skills.

          But what sets this book apart is its comprehensive coverage. You will
          learn to discern between good and bad code, transform problematic code
          into high-quality code, and understand the essentials of creating
          effective names, functions, objects, and classes. Martin also has a
          nice writing style, and he places a strong emphasis on practicality,
          which is demonstrated by extensive code examples and real-world
          scenarios. This is a big plus point for me, as it means your
          theoretical knowledge is grounded in actual coding practices. If you
          want a 1-line review, Clean Code is indispensable for developing and
          maintaining high standards in software development.

          The idea is that he challenges you to reassess your professional
          values and dedication to the craft of programming. I also appreciate
          that the book is divided into three parts: foundational principles of
          clean coding, engaging case studies, and a final compilation of
          heuristics and code “smells.” I know, code smells?!
